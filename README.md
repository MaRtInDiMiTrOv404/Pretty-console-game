Gameplay Overview:

The game is a text-based console application where the player engages in battles with enemies.
Each battle consists of the player and an enemy taking turns attacking each other until one of them is defeated.
The player earns money for defeating enemies, which can be used to purchase items from the shop.
The game continues until the player's health drops to 0 or below.

Battle Mechanics:
During battles, the player and the enemy take turns attacking each other.
Attacks deal random damage within a certain range (e.g., 5 to 15).
The player can choose to attack the enemy or visit the shop during their turn.
The enemy's attacks also deal random damage to the player.

Shop:
The shop offers two items for purchase: health potions and weapon upgrades.
Health potions restore a portion of the player's health.
Weapon upgrades enhance the player's attacking power.
Each item has a cost in terms of in-game currency (money).
Player Progression:
The player's health and attacking power can be improved by purchasing items from the shop.
As the player defeats more enemies and earns more money, they can afford better items and become stronger.
